## My carbon footprint

The carbon footprint is the quantity of carbon released in the atmosphere for a given activity.
Personal carbon footprint can be computed via free applications.

|| [OCE My carbone Footprint](https://www.oce.global/animations/CarbonFootprint-final/footprint.html) | [Nos gestes climat](https://nosgestesclimat.fr)| [MyC02](https://www.myco2.com) |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2020 | 4.9 | 4 | - |
| 2021 | 4.8 | 4.2 | - |
| 2022 | - | 3.8 | - |
| 2023 | - | 4.4 | - |
| 2024 | - | 4 | 4.6 |

where the unit t/y is the emitted tons of carbon per year. 

* [Nos Gestes Climat](https://nosgestesclimat.fr) and [MyCO2](https://www.myco2.com) rely on the personal data you provide to the application (with automatic completion for missing data). You can input your actual gas and electricity consumption in kWh. 
* [OCE Mon Empreinte Carbone](https://www.oce.global/animations/CarbonFootprint-final/footprint.html) aims to understand your behaviors and estimate your carbon footprint accordingly. All of them offer a comparison with the average population and suggest actions to help reduce your carbon footprint.

## Objective

The ambition of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/fr/processus-et-reunions/l-accord-de-paris/l-accord-de-paris) on climate change is to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to be as close as possible to 1.5°C and stay under 2°C of mean temperature rise of the planet.
