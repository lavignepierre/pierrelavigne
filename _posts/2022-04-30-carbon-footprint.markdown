## My carbon footprint

The carbon footprint is the quantity of carbon released in the atmosphere for a given activity.
Personal carbon footprint can be computed via free applications.

|| [OCE My carbone Footprint](https://www.oce.global/animations/CarbonFootprint-final/footprint.html) | [Nos gestes climat](https://nosgestesclimat.fr)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 2020 | 4.9 | 4 |
| 2021 | 4.8 | 4.2 |
| 2022 | - | 3.8 |

where the unit t/y is the emitted tons of carbon per year. I recommend using [Nos gestes climat](https://nosgestesclimat.fr) because it is based on the personal data you provide to the application (with automatic filling for missing data) while [OCE Mon Empreinte Carbone ](https://www.oce.global/animations/CarbonFootprint-final/footprint.html) instead seek to understand your behaviors and estimate your carbon footprint from that. However, the second application allows you to compare your results with those of other countries.


## Objective

The ambition of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/fr/processus-et-reunions/l-accord-de-paris/l-accord-de-paris) on climate change is to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to be as close as possible to 1.5°C and stay under 2°C of mean temperature rise of the planet.
