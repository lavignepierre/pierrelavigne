I"î<p>An ecologic transition commission has been created in 2020 at CMAP. Following other laboratories (see the IPSL working groupe <a href="https://climactions.ipsl.fr">climactions</a> for example) we aim at understanding what are the relevant actions for an ecological transition at the level of the department of mathematics. Information is available on the <a href="https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/le-laboratoire/commission-developpement-durable">web page</a> of the commission.</p>
