* December 14-15, 2022: [7th Green Finance Research Advances](https://www.institutlouisbachelier.org/evenement/gfra-7-fr/). To limit the carbon footprint of the conference, overseas participants and more generally those who cannot reach Paris by train within a reasonable amount of time, will be able to deliver their presentations online if they wish to do so.

* March 21-22, 2022: 15-th Financial international [risk forum](https://www.risks-forum.org).

* December 9, 2021: Organization of a sustainable development day at CMAP: see the [program](pdf-files/ProgrammeMatineeDD.pdf). Scientific work presented. Main topics: mathematics for energy systems, climate and green finance, biodiversity modeling. Also, the carbon footprint of the laboratory was presented.


* October 27-29, 2021: [Congrès des jeunes chercheurs en mathématiques appliquées](https://cjc-ma2021.github.io). Event in applied mathematics at École polytechnique (Palaiseau), organized by young researchers and supported by [SMAI](http://smai.emath.fr).

* An ecologic transition commission has been created in 2020 at CMAP. Following other laboratories (see the IPSL working groupe [climactions](https://climactions.ipsl.fr) for example) we aim at understanding what are the relevant actions for an ecological transition at the level of the department of mathematics. Information are available on the [web page](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/le-laboratoire/commission-developpement-durable) of the commission.
