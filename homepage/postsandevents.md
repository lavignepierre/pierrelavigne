* October 27-29, 2021: [Congrès des jeunes chercheurs en mathématiques appliqués](https://cjc-ma2021.github.io). Incoming event in applied mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique (Palaiseau), organized by young researcher and supported by [SMAI](http://smai.emath.fr).

* An ecologic transition commission has been created in 2020 at CMAP. Following other laboratories (see the IPSL working groupe [climactions](https://climactions.ipsl.fr) for example) we aim at understanding what are the relevant actions for an ecological transition at the level of the department of mathematics. Information are available on the [web page](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/le-laboratoire/commission-developpement-durable) of the commission.
