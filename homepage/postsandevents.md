# Incoming events

December 14-15, 2022: [7th Green Finance Research Advances](https://www.institutlouisbachelier.org/evenement/gfra-7-fr/). To limit the carbon footprint of the conference, overseas participants and more generally those who cannot reach Paris by train within a reasonable amount of time, will be able to deliver their presentations online if they wish to do so.

* An ecologic transition commission has been created in 2020 at CMAP. Following other laboratories (see the IPSL working groupe [climactions](https://climactions.ipsl.fr) for example) we aim at understanding what are the relevant actions for an ecological transition at the level of the department of mathematics. Information are available on the [web page](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/le-laboratoire/commission-developpement-durable) of the commission.
