## My carbon footprint

The carbon footprint is the quantity of carbon released in the atmosphere for a given activity.
Personal carbon footprint can be computed via free applications.

|| [OCE My carbone Footprint](https://www.oce.global/animations/CarbonFootprint-final/footprint.html) | [Nos gestes climat](https://nosgestesclimat.fr)|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Personal carbon footprint 2020 t/y | 4.9 | 4 |
| Personal carbon footprint 2021 t/y |  | 4.2 |

where the unit t/y is the emitted tons of carbon per year.

## Objective

The ambition of the [Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/fr/processus-et-reunions/l-accord-de-paris/l-accord-de-paris) on climate change is to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 to be as close as possible to 1.5°C and stay under 2°C of mean temperature rise of the planet.
